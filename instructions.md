## Data Options
### Tests
Currently there are only three options for tests. 
 1. SAT
 2. ACT
 3. AP

In the future there may be more added such as MCAT, GMAT, etc. For now, however, all test prep books/exams/questions should fall under one of these three tests. 
### Topics 
This list will grow as more information is added but for now we will simplify it using the following topics. 

- SAT 
	1. Reading Test
	2. Writing and Language Test
	3. Math Test
	4. Math Test - Calculator 
	5. Math Test - No Calculator
	6. Essay Test
- ACT
	1. English Test 
	2. Math Test 
	3. Reading Test 
	4. Science Test
- AP (This list will grow but the topic is simply the name that comes after the AP test. Example AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP U.S. History, etc.)
	1. Biology
	2. Chemistry
	3. Calculus


## Question structure overview 
Within test prep there are two main formats that we will see. First is a test prep book, second is a simple test prep exam. Each of these is set up slightly different so this guide will go over how the data should be structured in each scenario. 

Before we go into that let's go over the different parts that each question can have regardless of where it came from. 

 1. The question text
 2. The question number 
 3. The question topic
 4. The question scenario (optional)

Regardless of whether the question came from a book or an exam these pieces should always be present. Here are 3 examples. 

##### Example 1 (Barron's SAT Chapter 5: The SAT Math Test)

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aCJ1ENYkPx7zziXlhoeXclIAmv6QQVKmWIL-q1xbu9OIKPvXP2vn6SKSSw_BDS10pyE9pWOdrI)
We'll use problem 1 as our example. If we break down the different parts again 

 1. The question text = "In 1996, Diana read 10 English books..."
 2. The question number = 1
 3. The question topic = Math Test (We know this because it's in chapter on math)
 4. The question scenario = None (In this case it is a simple question and there's no scenario associated)
##### Example 2 (Barron's SAT Chapter 3: The SAT Reading Test)
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/r1-AUJ1W-j2jWK53vMrOvCb2CKoV9NaMQuKzr4dfgWioxB-RCHOnz6I_8Zlz9zJ5z9Ut7rBvXms)
 We'll use problem 2 as our example here. 
 
 1. The question text = "Which assertion about jellyfish is supported by the passage?..."
 2. The question number = 2
 3. The question topic = Reading Test (Once again this is pulled from the chapter)
 4. The question scenario = "The passage below is excerpted from a test on marine biology..."

##### Example 3 (SAT Practice Test 1)
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1YU3jExat0pG061y3TQni_xzjT8wGxQ1IwGEFG879ffUD8VPGL7TCsBJRHNpQl9iHPMUo4tVea4)
We'll use problem 3 as our example here. 

 1. The question text = In the figure above, lines t and m are parallell..."
 2. The question number = 3
 3. The question topic = Math Test - Calculator (In the test there is a section heading for section 4 that notes this)
 4. The question scenario = None

## Test Prep Books 
Test prep books can have a few different formats but there are still a few major pieces that questions from a test prep book will have.

1. Test
2. Book
3. Chapter (Optional)
4. Exam (Optional)

Taking from the example earlier this is what the data would look like. 
##### Example 1 (Barron's SAT Chapter 5: The SAT Math Test)

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aCJ1ENYkPx7zziXlhoeXclIAmv6QQVKmWIL-q1xbu9OIKPvXP2vn6SKSSw_BDS10pyE9pWOdrI)
We'll use problem 1 as our example. If we break down the different parts again 
1. The Book = Barron's SAT 
2. The Chapter = Chapter 5: The SAT Math Test
3. Exam = None 

So putting all of this together the data for this question would go as follows
|Test|Book|Chapter| Exam | Topic | Problem Number | Text | Scenario | 
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|SAT|Barron's SAT|Chapter 5: The SAT Math Test|None|Math Test|1|"In 1995..."|None|

##### Example 2 (Barron's SAT Chapter 6: Test Yourself)
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HkmKFt2XnGGhnFBAAQtFhuYps87Lwf07wzNiUtKLT1doDcbCZZPv3jxI_iDT6bEWo4vaSNTa32A)
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZWILHW7ylNFy8wqRYeepSbXdEWFeqf2liNMTAdlqkzzwC97Ag_0aAm-fZ6v5xC3JaQaDm326-LY)
This example becomes more unique. We are still in a test prep book (Barron's SAT) but we now have an exam within a chapter in that book. Because of this the exam data is now filled in. The data for this question would be as follows.
|Test|Book|Chapter| Exam | Topic | Problem Number | Text | Scenario | 
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|SAT|Barron's SAT|Chapter 6: Test Yourself|Model Test 2|Math Test - No Calculator |5|"At North Central..."|None|

##### Example 2 (Kaplan ACT Premier 2016)
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EfbPoIAmP8r1Ok_ssJGU-2PubhA7c0hbRor5XGif7fiLPyTyYbev3QyGUhZA9DNfXcl6CznOyUo)
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/j1uxY1pNmNWuDFeAfY3yvQA-UDYKOgTRPKPV2_9jyhbJ9dmbV_xHc7DB6jifTMAS1DmvEp0qazA)
This question once again has a different variation. Instead of being in a chapter, the exam this question comes from is a practice exam at the back of the book. The data for this would then be structured as follows. 

|Test|Book|Chapter| Exam | Topic | Problem Number | Text | Scenario | 
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|ACT|Kaplan ACT Premier 2016|None|Practice Test 2|Math Test|7|"Which express below..."|None|

## Test Prep Exams 
Test prep exams are more straightforward in their setup. The pieces of information here will be:

 1. Test
 2. Exam Name

##### Example 1 (SAT Practice Test 1)
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1YU3jExat0pG061y3TQni_xzjT8wGxQ1IwGEFG879ffUD8VPGL7TCsBJRHNpQl9iHPMUo4tVea4)
We'll use problem 3 as our example here. 

|Test|Book|Chapter| Exam | Topic | Problem Number | Text | Scenario | 
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|SAT|None|None|SAT Practice Test 1|Math Test - Calculator |3|"In the figure above..."|None|

##### Example 1 (SAT Practice Test 6)
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UjsC4eXY99tMP2k1xRY6y17afENYCCoh9AR8FBPs2NxEcW2DYP2__sqUDHDFl5G86j7LK0ltDZ0)

Using problem 7 as an example. 

|Test|Book|Chapter| Exam | Topic | Problem Number | Text | Scenario | 
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|SAT|None|None|SAT Practice Test 6|Reading Test|7|"It can reasonably..."|"Questions 1-10 are based..."|

To start adding a test prep exam click on the "Add Test Prep Exam" button. It will open the following page. 

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/npxix-gjfv2pB9efUa4Pkyvlb26aPDGIOGFIguL7hWVBCuVy2u5-7kSceUrVL2uDiY91hjir5v4)

The name field will be the name of the exam. (e.g. SAT Practice Test 1)
The book field is optional. Examples 2 and 3 in the [test prep book](#test-prep-books) section go over the scenarios we would use this. 
The test field will give you the option of choosing SAT, ACT, or AP. 

## Adding test prep book questions

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZnphIH-A8tSsDl9wfj4vmncZZcSTitDl_xI92s-kFqfNkAvi2YJpnjUcAN2wyTUELWJe1h8ag7U)

Start by clicking on the "Add Question" button. It will open the following page. 

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3usSpAh445HjcItpugmcOmM0heddEmWrQQKzff9OxSgy0I8vlNt3MfMWN2SFNw2afaN2SppEFfM)

From the dropdown menu select which book you would like to add a question to. 

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sxaCheybHZlWVWN5Ijo9Lb0aQxmoGeuU4_TOosRnlHrSb8PXVFS0OPTX3TlOLKR-3GcDZBaCQPQ)

From this point we have two options. 1) Select a chapter. 2) Select an exam that belongs to this book but not a chapter. 

##### Option 1: Adding a question to a chapter.
Once you have selected a chapter from the dropdown menu you will be presented with this page. 
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/T24dgzRVOLREKW5bmgQbO--adnixTfrgxDj7ptoO3lOVyRraTFPoirv3EGvfnMzhWgIOgVedMtc)

Once again we have two different options on this page. First we can continue without adding in a scenario based question. Examples 1 and 3 in the [question structure overview](#question-structure-overview) are examples of questions that do not have a scenario and so we can click the "Skip Ahead" button. 

If we do have a scenario based question - like example 2 in the [question structure overview](#question-structure-overview) - then we can either select an existing scenario using the "Use this scenario" link, or we can scroll to the bottom and create a new scenario. 

No matter what option you choose (1. No scenario, 2. Use existing scenario, 3. Create a new scenario) the following screen will come up.
